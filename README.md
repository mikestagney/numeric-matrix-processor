## Things learned

Linear algeabra

Recursion to calculate determinant

### Details

The six operations:

* Add matrices
* Multiply matrix by a constant
* Multiply matrices
* Transpose matrix
* Calculate a determinant
* Inverse matrix

Project created for JetBrains Academy Java Developer course - medium level project.

### How to use

### Sample input and output:
```
1. Add matrices
2. Multiply matrix by a constant
3. Multiply matrices
4. Transpose matrix
5. Calculate a determinant
6. Inverse matrix
0. Exit
```
Your choice: > 6\
Enter matrix size: > 3 3\
Enter matrix:\
\> &emsp;2 &emsp;-1 &emsp;0\
\> &emsp;0 &emsp;1 &emsp;2\
\> &emsp;1 &emsp;1 &emsp;0\
The result is:\
